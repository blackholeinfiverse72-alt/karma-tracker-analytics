## Integration Guide

### Unified Event Gateway

The recommended way to integrate with KarmaChain is through the unified event gateway:

```
POST /v1/karma/event
{
  "event_type": "life_event",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "data": {
    "role": "human",
    "action": "help",
    "description": "Helped a colleague with debugging"
  }
}
```

### Ecosystem Hooks

For direct integration with specific modules, use the karma API endpoints:

```
GET /api/v1/karma/{user_id}              # Get full karma profile
POST /api/v1/log-action/                 # Log user action
POST /api/v1/submit-atonement/           # Submit atonement completion
```

These endpoints provide module-specific scores for Finance, InsightFlow, Gurukul, and Game.

### File Upload Support

Upload files as evidence for atonement events:

```
POST /v1/karma/event/with-file
Form Data:
  - event_data: JSON string with event details
  - file: Upload file (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf, doc, docx)
```

### Supported Event Types

- `life_event`: Log karma actions and behaviors
- `appeal`: Submit karma appeals
- `atonement`: Request and complete atonement plans
- `atonement_with_file`: Atonement with supporting evidence files
- `death_event`: Record death events for karma transfer
- `stats_request`: Query user karma statistics

### Karmic Feedback Engine

Compute and retrieve karmic influence data:

```
POST /api/v1/feedback_signal              # Compute and publish feedback signal
GET /api/v1/feedback_signal/{user_id}     # Get feedback signal for a user
POST /api/v1/feedback_signal/batch        # Batch process multiple users
GET /api/v1/feedback_signal/health        # Check system health
GET /api/v1/feedback_signal/config        # Get engine configuration
```

### Behavioral State Normalization

Normalize multi-module behavioral inputs:

```
POST /api/v1/normalize_state              # Normalize single state
POST /api/v1/normalize_state/batch        # Normalize batch of states
```

### Karmic Analytics

Access karmic analytics and visualization:

```
GET /api/v1/analytics/karma_trends        # Get karmic trends data
GET /api/v1/analytics/charts/dharma_seva_flow  # Generate Dharma/Seva flow chart
GET /api/v1/analytics/charts/paap_punya_ratio  # Generate Paap/Punya ratio chart
GET /api/v1/analytics/exports/weekly_summary   # Export weekly summary CSV
GET /api/v1/analytics/metrics/live        # Get live karmic metrics
```

## Token Schema & Scoring System

### Advanced Karma Tokens

The system implements a comprehensive token schema based on Vedic principles:

#### Primary Tokens
- **DharmaPoints**: Righteous action points based on dharma compliance
- **SevaPoints**: Service and selfless action points
- **PunyaTokens**: Merit tokens for virtuous actions
- **PaapTokens**: Demerit tokens with severity levels (1-10)

#### Karma Types
- **DridhaKarma**: Fixed karma that must be experienced
- **AdridhaKarma**: Flexible karma that can be modified
- **SanchitaKarma**: Accumulated karma from past actions
- **PrarabdhaKarma**: Karma currently being experienced
- **Rnanubandhan**: Karmic debt relationships

### Purushartha Scoring

Actions are evaluated against the four Purushartha principles:

#### Dharma (Righteousness)
- Compliance with moral and ethical duties
- Adherence to universal laws and principles
- Impact on spiritual growth and liberation

#### Artha (Prosperity)
- Material and spiritual wealth generation
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Contribution to collective prosperity

#### Kama (Desire)
- Fulfillment of legitimate desires
- Balance between desire and restraint
- Impact on overall well-being

#### Moksha (Liberation)
- Progress toward spiritual liberation
- Reduction of karmic bonds
- Advancement on the path to enlightenment

### Q-Learning Integration

The system uses Q-learning algorithms to:
- Predict karmic outcomes based on user patterns
- Recommend optimal atonement plans
- Adapt scoring based on user behavior
- Provide personalized spiritual guidance

### Atonement System

Comprehensive atonement framework with three pillars:

#### Daan (Charity)
- Material donations and charitable acts
- Service to others and community support
- Resource sharing and generosity

#### Bhakti (Devotion)
- Spiritual practices and devotion
- Meditation, prayer, and ritual observance
- Cultivation of divine connection

#### Tap (Austerity)
- Self-discipline and penance
- Fasting and physical purification
- Mental and spiritual austerity practices

Each atonement type has specific units and effectiveness ratings based on the severity of PaapTokens being addressed.
